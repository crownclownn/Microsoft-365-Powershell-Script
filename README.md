⚠️ Important – Script Format & Usage

🔹 Why .ps1.txt instead of .ps1?

- Many organizations block .ps1 files for security reasons

- GitHub and email systems may flag executable scripts

- Prevents unintentional execution without review

🔹 Before using any script
You must convert the file from .ps1.txt to .ps1 and review the content.



✅ How to use the scripts

- Download the required script

- Open the file in a text editor (VS Code / Notepad++)

- Review and customize variables as needed

- Rename the file from ScriptName.ps1.txt ➝ ScriptName.ps1

- Run the script in a test tenant first
